# Music Files

Place your background music file here as `background-music.mp3`

The music player in the footer will automatically look for:
- `/music/background-music.mp3`

Supported formats:
- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- OGG
- M4A

Make sure the file is named exactly `background-music.mp3` for the auto-play functionality to work properly. 1
